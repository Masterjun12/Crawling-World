I'm not denying that Christian is controlling and at at times down right crazy, but that's what makes him such an endearing character to read. If people really thought about it, if they saw pass all the sex and the abuse, they would see a man falling in love for the first time! Yes the FIRST TIME! Christian truly loves Ana, and yes his ways of showing her are unorthodox, but at least he tries and the fact that she loves him back, is proof enough that he succeeds. Ana doesn't care about his past, she cares about and loves him! She's not a weak character! She changed her dull, boring life because she wanted to! Christian didn't force it upon her.

      "Christian Grey is no longer a man but a romanticized monster. A monster who sought out opportunities to deliberately inflict harm on Anastasia. A monster whose public plastic mask covered up his icily calculating eyes and that sickening smirk that said otherwise. A monster who knew how to cut Anastasia down with a few words in a matter of seconds. A monster who made Anastasia feel lonely in his arms and feel an ache for genuine affection. A monster who denied Anastasia of her sincere feelings and numbed her heart by constantly belittling and disrespecting Anastasia. A monster who is only protective when it suits his needs and desires and nothing else. A monster who has been severely abused during his childhood but instead of seeking for professional counseling, he deliberately chooses a helpless victim in Anastasia Steele and hurts her instead. A broken monster has been selected to be a role model for men to aspire to be. A broken man is deemed as a desirable perfect man to date for the women who watch these popular movies and read this famous and this scandalous book series. Anastasia Steele is no longer a woman but a romanticized victim of abuse. A victim who has been the helpless target of violence and insults by Christian Grey. A victim whose diet is automatically set by the same man who has exhibited many characteristics of an abuser. A victim who is deliberately isolated from her friends and family without any logical reason and isn’t permitted to find the time to socialize with anyone besides him. A victim is force-fed sugar-coated falsehoods and flattery from Christian Grey. A victim is given lavish gifts of all kinds but not given the proper amount of respect and love she deserves. Anastasia Steele should not be held up to be the role model of our time.\n",

The ONLY reason you wanted Ian, Matt, Theo, etc. to play the role, was because you've seen them in other films/programmes and you've seen them in the media. So start to give other people a chance and stop judging them before you've even seen them act! Plus you can quite clearly tell that Jamie is an amazing actor.

      "The relationship depicted in this series is an abusive one, very loosely based on BDSM. But, it is all purely fantasy. Saying this book causes young women to seek an abusive relationship is pretty dumb; the same as saying video games increases violence in teens. This book has NEVER claimed to be educational. It has never claimed to be a \"how to\" or a guide to a healthy BDSM relationship. This book is FICTIONAL and should be taken as such. If I'm not wrong, since this is erotica, it is probably targeted women with rape fantasies/dubious consent (ON PAPER, by the way. I don't mean in real life)/blurred consent/etc.\n",

But for many women, they prefer porn with storylines/plots where it is easily relatable. Thus, the production of this book. And many other millions of similar books.\n",

Just don't be hypocritical about it. Don't be sexist about it. I myself am not a fan of this series (I have neither read Twilight or this) but it is because I personally don't support of fanfiction getting published. Never have.

      "No I don't mean his interest in BDSM, that's a sexual taste and I have no issue with it. But that matters naught when it isn't consensual.\n",
      "It takes 5 minutes on Google and a bit of common sense  to know that this is not BDSM, (having a friend who is into this kind of thing and was in fits of laughter after reading the book helped a bit too) because a huge part of it is about mutual agreement. You can be as rough as you want but you have to both consent to it 100%. There's a huge difference between dominance for a kink and dominance as abuse.\n",
      "Steele is taken advantage of because of her lack of experience. Grey stalks her, pressures her and straight up ignores her attempts at compromise (he says it's either his way or no way). He never tells her about safe words or gives her any real understanding of what she is getting into, so she is utterly at his mercy even if she doesn't want to proceed, and he essentially rapes her at one point. Wow, what a guy!\n",
      "He's not a man introducing her to this whole new realm of sexual experiences, he's manipulating her to get what he wants. Had the book shown that she was coming back because she enjoyed the new experiences then I'd be singing a different tune about it being a thing that wasn't for everyone but did work for some, but it isn't. She comes back because he's mysterious and has power over her. She's a toy, and the fact that people find that attractive worries me.\n",

      "Okay, when I was reading the first book, I was like \"Not a sex scene again !\", but trust me. Int the second and third book, there is less of sex, and more of emotions, talks and other things. Also, after reading the trilogy, I have really connected so much with this book. Christian Grey , you think of him as \"super arrogant, rich, cocky, stupid a-hole who wnts ana for sex and is a scary rude man\", no, if you read more to this book, you will figure out how emotional, sweet, charming he is and how the scars of his past haunt him. You describe ana as \"innocent stupid girl who is weak and desperate\", no, ana is sweet, and strong. She is the only one who ever stands up to grey, talks back and argues with him spoiler alert, and SHE was the one who left grey. This book is not just some porno book about sex. It has lots of mysteries, moments which will make you cry and moments which will make you go into just \"aww\", you will be laughing, you will be sobbing. This book did that to me. I kinda didn't really like how twilight was written , and I thought this book will be the same. But this book was beyond my expectations and spectacular !﻿\n",

I mean, good Lord, Spader plays a lawyer w/ the last name of Grey, is into the exact same things as Christian, who's law office is somewhat similar to Christian's playroom as far as coloring, both Grey's have a blonde  their past causing them issues, both Grey's are perfectionist, and Maggie Gyllenhaal, whom he tries to control like Ana, you see walking around in the movie with things like Ana is in 50 shades darker, not to mention both have brown hair and blue eyes like Ana, they're both initially shy and weak characters in the beginning of the story whom they're both mesmerized with!  I think the writers for the original story and screen of Secretary, would agree since that story turned into a 2005 movie, then 6yrs later...50 shades gets published.  I know the author says the book/movie is based off her, but don't get me wrong, because I'm not trying to bash anything.
